# timely
Timely is a web app primarily built to assist organizations, such as schools, schedule meeting rooms or labs in a collaborative environment. 
I originally worked on this project for my high school because they required an upgrade from their old, inefficient system. 
The original design was much different, but I decided to revamp the project into Timely.

This project is still in development, so stay tuned for further features and updates! A live demo of the project will be made available soon.
