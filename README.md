**Timely** is a web app that assists organizations schedule meeting rooms in a collaborative environment. This project was built in partnership with my high school, as they required an upgraded system that allows teachers to schedule labs around the school.

## Development üõ†Ô∏è
**Timely** was my first web dev project, which uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. I also used the Syncfusion UI Library for easy-to-use and efficient GUI components. For the backend, I used PHP and Java. I also used the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for user authentication.

There are two themes that I created; one professional theme designed specifically with my high school in mind, and another more creative theme that I made for fun.

This project has been an incredible learning experience, as it has helped me build up my foundation of web development. In the future, I want to add other technologies into my projects, such as React or Next.js. I also want to learn TypeScript to enhance the knowledge I have in JavaScript.
