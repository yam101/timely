**Timely** is a web app primarily built to assist organizations, such as schools, schedule meeting rooms or labs in a collaborative environment. 
I originally worked on this project for my high school because they required an upgrade from their old, inefficient system. 
The original design was much different, but I decided to revamp the project into Timely.

This project is still in development, so stay tuned for further features and updates! 

## Development 🛠️
**Timely** was my first web dev project, so I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript from scratch to use in building this project. I used PHP and Java for the backend. For the GUI components, I used the Syncfusion UI Library. This project has been an incredible learning experience, as it has helped me build up my foundation of web dev. 

In the future, I want to add other frameworks into my projects, such as Next.js, and enhance my Javascript by learning Typescript. This project might be something I revist once I learn these technologies!
